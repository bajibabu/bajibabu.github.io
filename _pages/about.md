I am an Applied Scientist at Amazon. My work focus on making the speech generated by a text-to-speech (TTS) system more entertaining. Current research interest are speech understanding and generation, natural language processing and machine learning.

Prior joinig Amazon, I received a Ph.D degree in Speech and Language Technology from the School of Electrical Engineering at Aalto University. The title of my Ph.D. thesis is "_Improving the quality of text-to-speech (TTS) using deep learning--Emphasis on vocoders and speaking style adaptation_" advised by [Prof. Paavo Alku](http://users.spa.aalto.fi/paavo/).
